insufficient light) must be made before the start of play and must comply with competition rules.)}

\added{%
  Teams are given a 2 minute time period between the robot models being spawned
  and the start of the match.
  The start of the match is defined as the game state changing to READY for the
  first half time.
  At the beginning of the second half time, each half time in the extended
  period and the beginning of the penalty shootout,
  the referee will wait at least 15 seconds between spawning the robot models
  and transitioning to an active game state.
  Once the end of the match was declared by the referee and communicated by the
  GameController,
  teams receive a 2 minute time period to finish writing logs and properly shut
  down their program before the process will be terminated.
